					<h3>Extinction of the Tiger</h3>
					</center>
					<p>Tasmanian tigers used to live in Tasmania, which is Australia and parts of Papua New Guinea. They lived here because they enjoyed the open forest and grassland. The tasmanian tigers were nocturnal and usually lived alone or occassionally in small groups.They became extinct because humans were forcing them out of thier natural habitat by expanding the area in which they lived. They became officially extinct in 1936 when it passed away in Hobart Zoo.</p>
